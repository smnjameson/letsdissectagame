ÙOUR FAMILY HAS SPENT GENERATIONSENSURING THAT THE RULE OF THE ÄYNASTY OF ÍARK IS UNASSAILABLE IN THE ÅPSILONGALAXY.        Á NEW THREAT TO THE STABILITY OF YOUR RULE HAS RECENTLY ARISEN. ÒEALITYIS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS...        ÒESEARCH SCIENTIST WORKING ON NEW INTER-PLANETARY DRIVE SYSTEMS FORYOUR CRAFT MADE A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH INTHEIR UNDERSTANDING OF SPACE - WITHWORRYING CONSEQUENCES. ÉN PURSUIT OF A HYPERDRIVE MECHANISM THAT WOULD ALLOWSHIPS TO TAKE DIMENSIONAL SHORT-CUTS ON THE ROUTE FROM Á TO Â, SCIENTISTDISCOVERED ENTIRE NEW DIMENSIONS, IN FACT ÈITOTSU, ÆUTATSU, ÍITTSU, AND ÙOTTSU- EACH CLOAKED IN A DIFFERENT REALITY AND CONTAINING 6, 14 OR 30 BARRENPLANETS. ÆOUR NEW PLANET SYSTEMS...        Á FEW EXPLORATORY FORAYS REVEALED THAT THESE PLANET SYSTEMS APPEARED TOBE BUFFER ZONES THAT ACT AS AN UNINHABITED MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN YOUR HOMEUNIVERSE AND ALIEN DIMENSIONS THAT LIE BEYOND THEM. ÅACH PLANET SYSTEM CAN BEACCESSED DIRECTLY FROM ÓTARBASE, THE PLANET AT THE HEART OF EPSILON, YOUR SOLARSYSTEM - ACTIVATING THE HYPERDRIVE SYSTEM ON ÓTARBASE AND SETTING THEAPPROPRIATE CO-ORDINATES CAUSED ÓTARBASE TO SPPEAR AT THE EDGE OF ONE OF THEBUFFER PLANET SYSTEMS.        ÄURING AN EXPLORATORY FORAY INTO ÈITOTSU, THE 6-PLANET SYSTEM, A SUDDENCHANGE WAS NOTICED - ANOTHER PLANET HAD MATERIALIZED. ÒAPIDLY ACTIVATEDSCANNING SYSTEMS REVEALED THAT THERE WERE NOW EIGHT PLANETS IN THE SYSTEM --*STARBASE, THE SIX ARID PLANETS THAT HAD ALWAYS BEEN THERE, AND THE NEW ARRIVAL- WHICH SHOWED ALL THE SIGNS OF HARBORING SENTINENT LIFE.        ÊUMPING BACK THROUGH THE HYPERDRIVE PORTAL TO YOUR OWN REALITY TOCONSIDER THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT, YOU DECIDED TO PAY A VISIT TO THE OTHER THREEUNIVERSES - AND FOUND THAT THE PLANET COUNT IN EACH OF THEM HAD INCREASED BYONE. ÉT LOOKED LIKE SOMEONE ELSE FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE HAD JUST MADE THE SAMEDISCOVERY AS YOU AND WAS NOW ENTERING THE FOUR NEW PLANET SYSTEMS.        ÔHEN YOU DECIDED TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE ÈITOTSU STSTEM;CO-ORDINATES WERE SET ON THE HYPERDRIVE PLANT, THE ACTIVATE SWITCH THROWN - ANDTHE TRANSITION WAS MADE WITHOUT ANY ENERGY CONSUMPTION. ÓTARBASE TRANSCENDEDTHE DIMENTIONAL BARRIERS AND HAD BECOME A PERMANENT PART OF ÈITOTSU, A SYSTEMTHAT NOW CONTAINS EIGHT PLANETS.        Á WORRYING PROSPECT INDEED - THIS PERMANENT LINK BETWEEN ÈITOTSU ANDÅPSILON OPENED YOU TO THE THREAT OF ATTACK. ÆEARING THE WORST, YOU HURRIEDLY SETCO-ORDINATES FOR ÆUTATSU, ÍITTSU, AND ÙOTTSU - AND DISCOVERED THAT THEY TOOWERE NOW PERMANETLY LINKED TO YOUR HOME UNIVERSE.        ÆOUR ALIEN DIMENSIONS ARE NOW LINKED TO ÅPSILON VIA FOUR PLANET SYSTEM.ÙOUR ABSOLUTE RULE MIGHT SOON BE UNDER THREAT FROM FOUR ALIEN CIVILIVATIONS.ÃIVILIZATIONS THAT COULD THE BARREN PLANETS IN EACH OF THE NEW SYSTEMS TOSTOCKPILE ARMS AND EQUIPMENT BEFORE MOUNTING A DEVASTATING ATTACK ON ÅPSILONTHROUGH THE PERMANENTLY-OPEN PORTAL THAT STARBASE HAS NOW BECOME. Á WORRYINGPROSPECT INDEED - BUT WHAT CAN BE DONE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF YOUR HARD-WONEMPIRE?        ÔHERE IS ONLY ONE COURSE OF ACTION - TO GO ON THE OFFENSIVE AND DO UNTOTHE FOUR ALIEN CIVILIZATIONS WHAT THEY MOST CERTAINLY WANT TO DO UNTO YOU -ONLY DO IT FIRST, AND DO IT QUICKLY.        ×HILE APPROPRIATE MILITARY OPERATIONS WERE PUT UNDERWAY, DIPLOMATICTEAMS WERE DISPATCHED TO THE ALIEN PLANETS IN ÈITOTSU, ÆUTATSU, ÍITTSU,AND ÙOTTSU. ÂASIC NON-AGGRESSION PACTS WERE AGREED, A FEW SPIES LEFT BEHIND, ANDAN UNEASY PEACE INITIATED. ×ELL, AT LEAST THE TREATIES HAVE BOUGHT YOU SOMETIME, TIME THAT CAN BE USED TO GET READY.        ÁRMAMENT MANUFACTURING PLANTS ARE WORKING FLAT-OUT, PRODUCING CRAFT ANDEQUIPMENT. ÙOU HAVE EXAMINED ALL THE OPTIONS. ÎOW IT'S TIME TO GO ON THEOFFENSIVE...ÔÈÅ ÇÁÍÅ ÏÂÊÅÃÔÉÖÅÓ=============================================================================== ÙOU ARE THE COMMANDER AND SUPREME LEADER OF ÅPSILON, A UNIVERSE LOCATED AT THEVERY EDGE OF SPACE. ÓCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INTO A NEW DIMENSION-BUSTING HYPERDRIVEHAS HAD A RATHER UNFORTUNATE SIDE EFFECT - YOUR ÓTARBASE IS NOW PERMANENTLYLINKED TO AND PART OF FOUR BARREN PLANET SYSTEMS: ÈITOTSU, ÆUTATSU, ÍITTSU, ANDÙOTTSU. ÅACH OF THE FOUR PLANET SYSTEMS ACTS AS A BUFFER ZONE, AND IS LINKED TOONE OF THE FOUR NEW DIMENSIONS THAT ARE POPULATED BY ALIEN CIVILIZATIONS. ÃLEARLY, THIS SITUATION INTRODUCES AN UNWELCOME INSTABILITY INTO YOUR LIFE ASTHE COMMANDER OF ÅPSILON - SUDDENLY, THERE ARE NEW DIMENSIONS FOR YOU TOCONQUER. ÁND NEW DIMENSIONS WHICH, WITHOUT DOUBT, HARBOR ALIEN RACES JUST ASEAGER TO CONQUER YOUR HOME SYSTEM, ÅPSILON. ÙOUR INVESTIGATIONS HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT THE FOUR ALIEN RACES, LIKE YOUR OWNPEOPLE, ARE ORGANIZED UNDER A DICTATORIAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. ÙOUR OPPONENTS×OTOK, ÓMINE, ËRART, AND ÒORN HAVE ESTABLISHED BASES IN THE BUFFER PLANETSYSTEMS WHICH ARE NOW KNOWN AS ÈITOTSU, ÆUTATSU, ÍITTSU, AND ÙOTTSURESPECTIVELY. ÙOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO BECOME THE SUPREME RULER OF EACH OF THE FOUR PLANETSYSTEMS. ÏNLY WHEN ALL FOUR SYSTEMS ARE TOTALLY UNDER YOUR CONTROL CAN YOU FEELSAFE FROM THE THREAT OF ALIEN ATTACK. ÁND ONCE YOU HAVE CONTROL OF A PLANET SYSTEM, YOU CAN CONCENTRATEON AMASSINGTROOPS AND RESOURCES THERE, READY FOR AN INVASION OF THE ALIEN DIMENSION THATLIES BEYOND... ÂUT SUCH PLANS ARE OF THE FUTURE, ARE ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OFÏVERLORD 1. ÔHE FIRST PRIORITY IS SECURING THE SAFETY OF ÅPSILONÖICTORY ÃONDITIONS==================        ÏVERLORD OFFERS FOUR CAMPAIGNS: THE BATTLES FOR CONTROL OF ÈITOTSU,ÆUTATSU, ÍITTSU, AND ÙOTTSU. ÖICTORY IN EACH CAMPAIGN IS YOURS IF YOU CAN GAINCONTROL OF THE ALIEN BASE LOCATED AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE PLANET SYSTEM TOÓTARBASE; CONVERSELY, VICTORY FALLS TO THE ALIEN COMMANDER IF HE CAN WRESTÓTARBASE FROM YOUR GRASP.        ÔHERE IS NO TIME LIMIT SET ON A CAMPAIGN - THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES UNTILYOU QUIT THE MISSION OR ONE SIDE WINS. ÏNCE A CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN STARTED YOUCANNOT INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FROM ELSEWHERE, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TOSHIP CRAFT AND MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM ÅPSILON TO HELP YOUR WAR EFFORT.ÎATURALLY, SUCH EQUIPMENT HAS TO BE PAID FOR, AND IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEINTER-DIMENSIONAL EQUILIBRIUM, APPROPRIATE RESOURCES MAY ALSO HAVE TO BESHIPPED BACK TO ÅPSILON IN EXCHANGE FOR EQUIPMENT.        ÆOOD, ÆUEL, ÅNERGY, ÃREDITS, ÍINERALS AND PEOPLE ARE PRESENT ONÓTARBASE WHEN A CAMPAIGN BEGINS AND ARE THE ECONOMIC ÒESOURCES THAT NEED TO BEMANAGED WITH CARE IF YOU ARE TO SUCCEED. ÎEUTRAL PLANETS CAN BE COLONIZED ANDENEMY PLANETS CAN BE CONQUERED. ÒEMEMBER, WHEN A PLANET IS UNDER YOUR CONTROL,YOU CAN EXTRACT ÒESOURCES THAT ARE USEFUL TO THE WAR EFFORT.ÃHOOSING Á ÐLANET ÓYSTEM========================        ÔHE FOUR MISSIONS CAN BE ATTEMPTED IN ANY ORDER YOU CHOOSE, AND ANINDIVIDUAL MISSION CAN BE ATTEMPTED AS MANY TIMES AS YOU LIKE (ALTHOUGH THESTART CONDITIONS VARY SLIGHTLY EACH TIME).        ÈITOTSU CONTAINS 8 PLANETS AND YOU ARE UP AGAINST A FAIRLY INEPT ALIENCOMMANDER. ÆUTATSU CONTAINS 16 PLANETS, AND YOU COMPETE AGAINST AN ALIENLIFE-FORM THAT IS RATHER MORE EXPERIENCED AT GOVERNMENT AND THE STRATEGIES OFWAR. ÍITTSU CONTAINS 32 PLANETS AND YOU FIGHT A HIGHLY-EXPERIENCED OPPONENT WHOIS WELL-VERSED IN THE SKILLS OF GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY STRATEGY.        ÏBVIOUSLY, THE MORE PLANETS THERE ARE IN A SYSTEM, THE MORE COMPLEX THETASK MANAGING ÒESOURCES AND DEPLOYING YOUR MILITARY FORCES BECOMES.        ÔHE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE IS PRESENTED BY ÙOTTSU, ANOTHER 32-PLANETSYSTEM. ÔHE CREATURE YOU CHALLENGE THERE IS REMARKABLY SOPHISTICATED AT THEARTS OF WAR AND GOVERNMENT - YOU WILL FIND HIM IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERTHROW UNLESSYOU HAVE TRAINED YOURSELF THOROUGHLY IN THE OTHER ARENAS FIRST.        ×HEN YOU FIRST ENTER A PLANET SYSTEM, ÓTARBASE IS A FUNCTIONAL COLONY -BUT THE ÒESOURCES YOU FIND ON ÓTARBASE ARE LIMITED, AND YOU DO NOT HAVE ANARMY. ÙOUR OPPONENT, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN BUSY, ANTICIPATING THE START OFHOSTILITIES. ÙOUR FIRST OBJECTIVE MUST BE TO ASSESS THE TASK THAT LIES AHEAD.ÔHEN YOU HAVE TO DEVELOP YOUR OWN STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS.        ÔHE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO DEVELOP YOUR SKILLS AS A PLAYER OF ÏVERLORDIS IN THIS MANUAL. ÏNCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THE CONTROL SYSTEM, SERIOUS PLAY CANBEGIN.ÃÏÎÔÒÏÌÉÎÇ ÏÖÅÒÌÏÒÄ===============================================================================ÍÁÉÎ ÓÃÒÅÅÎ===========   ÔHIS IS THE SCREEN THAT APPEARS WHEN YOU FIRST ENTER ONE OF THE FOUR PLANETSYSTEMS. ÆROM HERE, YOU ACCESS CONTROLS AVAILABLE TO YOU DURING PLAY, RECIEVEMESSAGES ON THE VIDEO TELEPRINTER CONSOLE, AND GAIN AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRESSOF THE GAME.   ×HEREVER YOU ARE, WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING, ONE CLICK ON THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTONRETURNS YOU HERE (ÕNLESS YOU ARE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF BUYING OR RENAMINGSOMETHING, IN WHICH CASE THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON WILL BE TEMPORARILY USED AS THEÅÎÔÅÒ KEY. ÔWO CLICKS OF THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON WILL GET YOU TO THE ÍAINÓCREEN.)ÔHE ÓYSTEM ÍAP==============ÁN AT-A-GLANCE GUIDE TO HOW THINGS ARE GOING IN THE CURRENT SOLAR SYSTEM.   ÙOUR ÓTARBASE IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MAP AND THE ENEMY'S BASE IS AT THETOP. ÔHE COLORED DOTS THAT ORBIT AROUND THE AXIS OF THE STAR MAP REPRESENTS THEPLANETS: RED REPRESENTS A PLANET UNDER CONTROL OF THE ENEMY; BLUE REPRESENTS ANEUTRAL, UNFORMATTED PLANET; WHITE INDICATES A PLANET THAT IS BEING FORMATTED,EITHER BY YOU OR THE ENEMY. Á DOT THAT FLASHES BETWEEN GREEN AND RED INDICATESA PLANET THAT IS CURRENTLY EMBROILED IN BATTLE. ÙOUR OPPONENTS FACE APPEARS INSILHOUETTE BEHIND THE ÓYSTEM ÍAP - THE CLEARER YOU CAN SEE HIM, THE CLOSER HEIS TO VICTORY.ÐLANET ÉNFORMATION==================   ÔHE ICON AT THE TOP LEFT OF THE ÓYSTEM ÍAP DISPLAY CALLS UP BASIC INFORMATIONON THE CURRENT PLANET - IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THAT THE LARGER A PLANET IS,THE LONGER IT TAKES TO FORMAT. ÔHIS ICON ALSO GIVES A BREAKDOWN ON THE STATUSOF THE ENTIRE PLANET SYSTEM, REVEALING THE NUMBER OF PLANETS UNDER YOURCONTROL, THE NUMBER OF PLANETS UNDER ENEMY CONTROL AND THE NUMBER OF PLANETSTHAT HAVE YET TO BE FORMATTED.ÈOME ËEY========   ÔHE ICON AT THE BOTTOM LEFT OF THE ÓYSTEM ÍAP DISPLAY IS THE 'HOME KEY' -CLICK ON IT TO MOVE THE PLANET CURSOR DIRECTLY TO ÓTARBASE.ÐAUSE AND ÓOUND ÃONTROLS========================   ÃLICK ON THE EAR TO TOGGLE SOUND EFFECTS ON OR OFF. ÃLICKING ON THE HANDPAUSES THE GAME, AND THE ICON BECOMES SILVER-COLORED - CLICK ON IT AGAIN, ORCLICK THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON TO RESUME PLAY.ÃONTROL ÐANEL=============   ÃLICKING ON THESE ICONS GIVES ACCESS TO THE OTHER ÃONTROL ÓCREENS WITHINÏVERLORD. ÌEARN TO RECOGNIZE THESE ICONS - THEY ALSO APPEAR ON OTHER SCREENS,WHERE THEY ALLOW YOU TO GO DIRECTLY TO ANOTHER ÃONTROL ÓCREEN WITHOUT RETURNINGTO THE ÍAIN ÓCREEN FIRST.ÔÈÅ ÐÌÁÎÅÔ ÔÙÐÅÓ================   ÖOLCANIC - ÈORTICULTURAL ÓTATIONS AND ÓOLAR ÓATELLITES WORK HERE, BUT THEREAL GAINS ARE MADE IF YOU SET UP MINING OPERATIONS. Á BASIC ÍINING ÓTATIONPRODUCES FIVE TIMES THE YIELD OF ÍINERALS AND THREE TIMES THE YIELD OF ÆUEL ONA VOLCANIC PLANET AS IT DOES ON ANY OTHER PLANET TYPE.   ÄESERT - ÆARMING AND ÍINING OPERATIONS PROCEED AT NORMAL, BASIC RATES BUTTHE ENERGY YIELD FROM ORBITING ÓOLAR ÓATELLITES IS MUCH INCREASED OWING TO THETHIN ATMOSPHERE THAT CLOAKS ÄESERT PLANETS - VERY LITTLE ÅNERGY IS LOST WHEN ITIS BEAMED DOWN TO THE PLANETS CAPACITOR STORAGE DEVICES.   ÔROPICAL - ÎORMAL, BASIC YIELDS ARE OBTAINED FROM ÍINING ÓTATIONS AND ÓOLARÓATELLITES, BUT AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED, YOU GET SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FOOD FROM AÈORTICULTURAL ÓTATION WHEN IT IS INSTALLED ON A TROPICAL PLANET AS IT UTILIZESSOME OF THE LOCAL FLORA AND FAUNA IN THE PRODUCTION OF FOOD.   ÍETROPOLIS - ÓTARBASE IS A ÍETROPOLIS PLANET. ÔHESE PLANETS ARE GOOD REVENUEEARNERS - THE QUANTITY OF CREDITS PER UNIT OF TIME YOU RECIEVE FROM SETTING AGIVEN TAX RATE ON A GIVEN SIZE OF POPULATION IS MUCH HIGHER ON A METROPOLISPLANET THAN ON ANY OTHER PLANET TYPE.ÔÈÅ ÐÌÁÎÅÔ ÓÕÒÆÁÃÅ===============================================================================   ÁT ANY ONE TIME, A MAXIMUM OF NINE CRAFT CAN BE LOCATED ON A GIVEN PLANET -THERE ARE THREE SPACES IN THE ÄOCKING ÂAYS, AND SIX PLATFORMS ON THE SURFACE OFTHE PLANET ITSELF.   ÉN ORDER TO LAND A CRAFT FROM ORBIT (OR BEFORE YOU CAN BUY A CRAFT ONÓTARBASE) THERE HAS TO BE A VACANT ÄOCKING ÂAY AVAILABLE TO RECEIVE IT. ÔHISMAY MEAN LAUNCHING A CRAFT AND PARKING IT IN ORBIT - THERE'S UNLIMITED ROOM INTHE SPACE LANES - OR IT MAY MEAN TRANSFERRING SOMETHING FROM A ÄOCKING ÂAY OUTONTO THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET TO MAKE ROOM.   ÒEMEMBER: ÈORTICULTURAL AND ÍINING ÓTATIONS ONLY PRODUCE ÒESOURCES WHEN THEYHAVE BEEN MOVED OUT ON THE SURFACE OF A PLANET AND ACTIVATED.   ÔHE ÐLANET ÓURFACE ÓCREEN ALLOWS YOU TO MOVE CRAFT BETWEEN THE SIX PLATFORMSON THE PLANET AND THE THREE ÄOCKING ÂAYS. ÔO MOVE A CRAFT OUT, CLICK ON ITSNAME IN THE ÄOCKING ÂAY PANEL. ÔO MOVE IT BACK INTO A VACANT ÄOCKING ÂAY, CLICKON THE VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE CRAFT THAT APPEARS WHEN IT OCCUPIES ASURFACE PLATFORM.   ÁND TO TURN ON A ÍINING OR ÈORTICULTURAL ÓTATION, SIMPLY CLICK ONCE ON THE'ÏÎ/ÏÆÆ' TOGGLE SWITCH... YOU MAY NEED TO CHECK ALL YOUR ÍINING ANDÈORTICULTURAL ÓTATIONS AFTER A COSMIC STORM OR ENERGY FAILURE - THEY HAVE ANASTY HABIT OF SWITCHING THEMSELVES OFF AND GOING UNNOTICED UNTIL STORES HAVEDROPPED DANGEROUSLY LOW.ÍÁÎÁÇÉÎÇ ÒÅÓÏÕÒÃÅÓ===============================================================================        ÍANAGING RESOURCES IS ONE OF THE KEYS TO SUCCESS IN ÏVERLORD. ÉT ISIMPORTANT TO MONITOR LEVELS OF ÆOOD, ÅNERGY, ÍINERALS, ÆUEL, ÃREDITS AND ÐEOPLEON ALL THE PLANETS YOU CONTROL. ÁS WELL AS USING ÒESOURCE-CREATING EQUIPMENT,YOU SHOULD ALSO REMEMBER TO PROTECT PLANETS THAT PRODUCE RESOURCES FROM ENEMYATTACK.        ÔHE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE ÒESOURCES WITH WHICH YOU HAVE TO DEALDEPENDS ON WHICH OF THE PLANET SYSTEMS YOU ARE SEEKING TO CONQUER, AND ON THESTRATEGIES YOU CHOOSE TO ADOPT WHEN PLAYING THE GAME.ÃREDITS AND ÐOPULATION======================        ÃREDITS ARE VITAL: THEY ARE NEEDED TO BUY WEAPONS FOR YOUR SOLDIERSWHEN YOU COMMISION YOUR RECRUITS INTO PLATOONS, AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE SUFFICIENTFUNDS IN THE ÓTARBASE TREASURY TO PAY FOR EQUIPMENT ORDERED ON THE ÂUY ÓCREENS.        ÔHE MAIN SOURCE OF CREDITS IS TAXATION - YOU CAN SET THE TAX RATE THATPREVAILS ON EACH OF YOUR COLONIES BY ACCESSING THE ÇOVERNMENT ÓCREEN, BUT IFYOU SET THE TAX TOO HIGH ON A PLANET, THE POPULATION'S MORALE WILL SUFFER ANDAS A CONSEQUENCE, THE RATE AT WHICH THE POPULATION INCREASES WILL BEGIN TO SLOWDOWN.        ÉF THE TAX RATES ARE TOO HIGH, POPULATION MAY CEASE TO GROW AT ALL, ANDIF ÆOOD STOCKS FALL BELOW LEVELS NEEDED TO SUSTAIN POPULATION, THEN PEOPLESTART TO DIE. ÉN SUCH AN EMERGENCY, YOU CAN OBTAIN TEMPORARY RESPITE BY MOVINGPEOPLE INTO CRYOGENIC STORAGE IF YOU HAVE ANY CRAFT IN THE ÄOCKING ÂAYS OF APLANET, OR INTO THE ARMY IF THE FOOD SHORTAGE OCCURS ON ÓTARBASE - PEOPLE INTHE ARMY OR ON BOARD A SHIP DO NOT CONSUME ÆOOD.        ÉTS WORTH BEARING IN MIND THAT MUCH HIGHER REVENUE PER UNIT OF TIME ISRECIEVED ON A ÍETROPOLIS PLANET FOR A GIVEN TAX RATE, SO YOU MAY WISH TOCONCENTRATE ON BUILDING THE POPULATION ON ÓTARBASE AND OTHER ÍETROPOLIS PLANETSYOU FORMAT DURING A GAME. ÉT'S WELL WORTH KEEPING THE POPULATION LEVEL ONÓTARBASE AS HIGH AS YOU CAN - IT'S THE ONLY COMMUNITY FROM WHICH YOU CANRECRUIT NEW SOLDIERS AND OBTAIN CREW FOR NEW SHIPS.        ÃREDITS CAN ALSO BE RAISED IN CASE OF DIRE EMERGENCY BY SCRAPPING CRAFTON THE ÄOCKING ÂAY ÓCREEN, OR BY DECOMMISSIONING ÐLATOONS THAT ARE LOCATED ONÓTARBASE (ÁCHIEVED ON THE ÐLATOON ÍANAGEMENT ÓCREEN).        ÃREDITS CAN BE SHIPPED BACK TO ÓTARBASE FROM YOUR COLONIES ALMOSTINSTANTANEOUSLY - CLICKING ON THE APPROPRIATE ICON ON THE ÇOVERNMENT ÓCREENACTIVATES AN ELECTRONIC TRANSFER OF FUNDS.        ÉN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HIGHER TAXATION YIELDS ON ÍETROPOLISPLANETS OR TO ENSURE A SUPPLY OF CIVILIANS FOR THE DRAFT, YOU MAY NEED TO MOVEPEOPLE AROUND A PLANET SYSTEM.ÆOOD, ÍINERALS, ÆUEL AND ÅNERGY===============================   ×HEN YOU START A NEW GAME, ÓTARBASE IS SEEDED WITH A QUANTITY OF ÒESOURCES.ÓIMILARLY, WHEN A PLANET IS FORMATTED THE ÁTMOSPHERE ÐROCESSOR DELIVERS SOMEBASIC SUPPLIES TO THE NEWLY-ESTABLISHED COLONY.   ÉN ORDER TO LIVE AND MULTIPLY IN NUMBER, PEOPLE NEED TO CONSUME ÆOOD.ÄEPENDING ON WHICH PLANET SYSTEM YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO CONQUER, ÍINERALS ANDÅNERGY MAY BE NEEDED BACK ON ÓTARBASE TO FUND PURCHASES MADE ON THE ÂUYÓCREENS. ÅNERGY IS USED BY ÍINING ÓTATIONS AND ÆARMING ÓTATIONS WHEN THEY AREOPERATIONAL, AND ÆUEL IS NEEDED BY MOST CRAFT TO TRAVEL THROUGH SPACE.   ÔHE ONLY CERTAIN WAY TO INCREASE STOCKS OF ÆOOD, ÍINERALS, ÆUEL AND ÅNERGYIS TO ACQUIRE THE APPROPRIATE EQUIPMENT AND MANUFACTURE THEM, ALTHOUGHÒESOURCES CAN BE CAPTURED AS THE SPOILS OF WAR.   ÍINING ÓTATIONS PRODUCE MORE ÆUEL AND ÍINERALS WHEN THEY ARE SITED ONÖOLCANIC PLANETS, ÆARMING ÕNITS PRODUCE MORE ÆOOD IF THEY ARE LOCATED ON AÔROPICAL ÐLANET, AND ÓOLAR ÓATELLITE ÇENERATORS YIELD ÅNERGY MORE RAPIDLY IFTHEY ARE IN ORBIT AROUND A ÄESERT ÐLANET.   ÓIGNIFICANT GAINS CAN BE MADE BY DEPLOYING YOUR ÒESOURCE-GENERATINGEQUIPMENT WISELY, ESTABLISHING COLONIES THAT SPECIALIZE IN CONTRIBUTING APARTICULAR ÒESOURCE TO YOUR OVERALL ECONOMY - BUY THAT STILL LEAVES THE PROBLEMOF TRANSPORTING ÒESOURCES TO THE PLANETS THAT NEED THEM...ÍOVING ÒESOURCES ÁROUND Á ÐLANET ÓYSTEM=======================================   ÉDEALLY, EVERY PLANET UNDER YOUR CONTROL WILL BE TOTALLY SELF-SUFFICIENT,PRODUCING ALL THE ÆOOD AND ÅNERGY IT NEEDS TO SURVIVE, BUT SUCH EQUILIBRIUM ISCERTAINLY NOT EASY TO ACHIEVE, AND IN CERTAIN SCENARIOS, PROVES IMPOSSIBLE.ÆROM TIME TO TIME YOU WILL NEED TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY SHIPMENT OF ÆOOD, ANDSOMETIMES ÆUEL AND ÅNERGY, FORM ONE PLANET WITH A SURPLUS TO ANOTHER WITH APRESSING SHORTAGE.   ×HILE ÃREDITS CAN BE MOVED BACK FROM PLANETS UNDER YOUR CONTROL TO THEÓTARBASE TREASURY BY CLICKING ON THE APPROPRIATE ICON ON THE ÇOVERNMENT ÓCREEN,YOU MAY NEED TO EFFECT A PHYSICAL TRANSFER OF ÍINERALS OR ÅNERGY BACK TOÓTARBASE IN ORDER TO SATISFY THE ASKING PRICE FOR A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT YOU WANTTO BY.ÒELOCATING ÙOUR ÐEOPLE======================   ÙOU MAY WISH TO MOVE PEOPLE FROM PLANET TO PLANET - A POPULATION MIGHT HAVEBEEN ALLOWED TO DWINDLE TO ZERO ON ONE OF YOUR POSSESSIONS, OR YOU MAY WISHTO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EXTRA-HIGH YIELD FROM TAXES THAT YOU ENJOY ONÓTARBASE OR ANOTHER ÍETROPOLIS PLANET BY SHIPPING IN SOME PEOPLE FROM LESSECONOMICALLY-REWARDING PLANETS. ÏR YOU MAY NEED TO TAKE PEOPLE BACK TO ÓTARBASESO THEY CAN BE DRAFTED INTO YOUR ARMY.   ×ITH THE EXCEPTION OF ÃREDITS, ÒESOURCES ARE SHIPPED AROUND THE PLANETSYSTEM AS CARGO. ÓMALL AMOUNTS CAN BE LOADED INTO THE CARGO HOLDS OF ÂATTLEÃRUISERS, ÈORTICULTURAL ÓTATIONS AND ÍINING ÓTATIONS, WHICH IS WORTH BEARING INMIND IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO MAKE A JOURNEY ANYWAY. ÆOR REAL BULK TRANSPORT,HOWEVER, YOU NEED THE HEAVY-DUTY TRUCK OF THE SPACELANES - A ÃARGO ÃRUISER.   ÔHE ÃARGO ÂAY ÓCREEN IS USED TO LOAD AND UNLOAD CARGO AND PASSENGERS - ONCEA SHIP IS IN A ÄOCKING ÂAY, YOU SELECT IT BY CLICKING ON ITS NAME (UNLESS IT ISTHE ONLY SHIP IN A ÄOCKING ÂAY ON THE CURRENT PLANET, IN WHICH CASE IT ISAUTOMATICALLY SELECTED AS THE CURRENT SHIP FOR ÃARGO ÂAY OPERATIONS.)   ÐROVIDING A SHIP HAS THE CAPACITY TO CARRY PASSENGERS (CHECK THE STATUSPANEL THE APPEARS AT THE TOP CENTER OF THE ÃARGO ÂAY ÓCREEN FOR DETAILS ON THECURRENTLY SELECTED CRAFT), PEOPLE FROM THE POPULATION OF THE CURRENT PLANET CANBE PUT INTO CRYOGENIC STORAGE AND MOVED INTO THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENTS OF THECURRENT SHIP.
